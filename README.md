# Wine-quality-assessment

##### Group Members: Katherine Hong, Mimi George, Shipra Gupta, Fiza Tariq, Nivetha Sundar

#### Dataset UCI ML Archives- [wine+quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

#### Proposal

Our project will focus on predicting the quality of wine, depending on feature variables such as acidity, alcohol quantity, pH, etc. 

#### Questions
1. How do different factors affect the wine quality in red and white wine?
2. Compare and contrast the features that affect red and white wine.
3. What are some outlying factors that should be taken into account when measuring the quality of both types of wine?
4. What are the steps taken to improve the accuracy of our model?
5. Can we group/cluster wines based on their chemical compositions? 

#### Outline
##### Models - 
* Classification
* Linear Regression (accuracy R2, mean score)
* Possibly Neural Network Optimization (tensorflow, accuracy)
